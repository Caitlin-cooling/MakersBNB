Hosts can create listings for spaces that they would like to let out including a title, description, price and dates that it is available for.

A guest can then request a one night stay from any of the available dates and they will be able to see any of the bookings that they have requested in their Submitted bookings page.

By default, your booking will be pending, awaiting the hosts response. The host can see their received bookings in their received bookings page. Once they have either accepted or declined that booking both the guest and the host will see the updated status. If the booking is confirmed, the date will then no longer be available to book.
